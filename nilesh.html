  <p>I taught my final course in Fall 2019.You can view a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uQRrNdpMsU&t=1329s">video of my last lecture</a>, which was not about computer science.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Khan Academy now carries <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">algorithms tutorials</a>for which <a href="https://rlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/devin/">Devin Balkcom</a>and I produced content.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>My newest book is Algorithms Unlocked. The Amazon site for the book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Unlocked-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262518805/">here</a>, and the MIT Press site is <a
      href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-unlocked">here</a>.<br>I maintain an <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/au-bugs/bugs-1e.php">errata page</a>for Algorithms Unlocked. if you find an error in the book and it's not already
    in the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/au-bugs/bugs-1e.php">errata page</a>, send email to <a href="mailto:algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu">algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu</a>.(The email address in the preface of the book is incorrect--the
    first known error in the book.) <br>Algorithms Unlocked is the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/AU-10K.html">10,000th book title published by MIT Press</a>.</p>
